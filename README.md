# Projets-Barrieres-Exotiques
Third Year Project at Ecole Polytechnique. 

In this project we implement the predictor corrector algorithm on a counter example (long and winding central path) for strong-polynomial complexity for Log-barrier interior point methods in linear programming.

Our implementation confirms the results predicted in the paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01544.pdf] by X. Allamigeon, P. Benchimol, S. Gaubert and M. Joswig .
